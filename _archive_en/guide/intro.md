# About

InPageEdit is a MediaWiki plugin made by 机智的小鱼君 (DragonFish) in JavaScript which has good mobile optimization and useless colorful design. The main purpose is allowing users to use many MediaWiki functions without opening a new tab (including but not only "editing"), which speeds up the wiki maintaining process. The plugin is also modular designed, and providing many SDKs.
