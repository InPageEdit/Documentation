You can help me improve the Documention Center, the newest and gigantic to-do; if you know some JavaScript, you can also help me improve the plugin.

## Financial Support

If you are so into InPageEdit that you even wanna support the author in a financial way, DM him via QQ! ~~Don't have the plan to get the transferring QR code into pubic yet because I'm sure thar I'll be attacked very fiercely~~
